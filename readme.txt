Displays the categories for a single post in the sidebar.

== Description ==

This plugin was created to show the categories for a single post in the sidebar.

The categories will be displayed in an unordered list.

You can choose the title for the widget in the sidebar if you wish.

**If you're using the plugin, please drop the link to your blog [here](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-posts-categories-in-sidebar-using-this-widget).**

Example:

	<li id="cz_post_cat-3" class="widget-container widget_cz_post_cat">
		<h3 class="widget-title">Topics</h3>
		<div class="cz-post-cats">
			<ul class="cz-cat-ul">
				<li class="cz-cat-li"><a href="http://xxx.xxx.xxx/topic/facebook/">Facebook</a></li>
				<li class="cz-cat-li"><a href="http://xxx.xxx.xxx/topic/jobs/">Jobs</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</li>

It uses the `is_single()` query in php so that it ONLY shows up on single posts. Not pages.
